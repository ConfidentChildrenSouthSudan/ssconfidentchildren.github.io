			One of the most graphic examples of this need is the number of boys and girls living on the streets and in slums, cemeteries, markets, and "rakubas" (broken shacks made of materials salvaged from trash heaps). Girls, in particular, become targets for child trafficking. In a new country struggling to create infrastructure and social justice systems, the role of nonprofit humanitarian projects is essential.</p>

			<p>CCC began as a drop-in center operating from one house. Today, there is a residential center, playground and area for meals accommodating up to 84 children. Dormitory rooms are decorated with stuffed toys, books and linens to feel comfortable and safe.
