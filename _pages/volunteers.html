			<p>If you have a desire to help, and a passion to improve the lives of vulnerable children, then please get in touch about volunteering at CCC. We have volunteering opportunities specifically for the care facility (i.e. daily duties with the children and specific activities dependent on your interests/skills) and opportunities to work alongside us in our office, which is also based at the center.</p>

			<p>We love hosting volunteers - short-term and long-term. We have a group of regular volunteers in-country, but we are happy to accommodate international volunteers on an individually assessed basis.</p>
			
			<p>All volunteers must sign a code of conduct to work with children, as you will have regular contact with the girls and boys in the centre. You will also need to meet certain reference requirements.</p>
			
			<p>To volunteer you should: </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Be over 20 years old</li>
			    <li>Be able to fund your own travel and living costs (e.g. flights, food, laundry, accommodation, visas etc)</li>
			    <li>1 month = approx. $3,000</li>
			    <li>6 months = approx. $13,500</li>
			    <li>12 months = approx. $25,000</li>
			    <li>Sign a contract of commitment for the specified period</li>
			    <li>Enjoy working directly with children</li>
			    <li>Have an understanding or experience of working with vulnerable populations</li>
			</ul>

			</ul>    
			<p>Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you are interested in volunteering in a different role to those we have online, as we assess potential volunteers on an individual basis. No skill is unimportant, and no level of experience is necessarily required â€“ just a loving heart, and a passion to help!</p>
