			<p>Cathy Groenendijk has been the driving force behind CCC, delivering services, support and safety to children of South Sudan (formerly Sudan) from 2007 when the organisation was founded. With a team of highly committed South Sudanese volunteers and staff, Cathy is able to continue providing a safe space for children affected by protracted crises in the country, including the most recent conflict, which broke out in 2013.</p>

			<p>With the support of South Sudanese volunteers, Cathy began providing support to some of these children. As she provided food, the facilities for them to wash, and clean clothes for them to wear, she learned about the violence and abuse many of these girls had been exposed to. Her home became a drop-in centre for up to 30 girls at a time. Very quickly it became apparent there was a need for a structured support system for these vulnerable children; a safe place for them to be, off the streets, and somewhere they could call home.</p>

			<p>In 2011, with further support Cathy was able to accommodate the children in a new facility in Juba. The current care centre can accommodate up to 40 children at any one time. There are currently around 30 girls and boys aged between 2 - 17 based at the centre, just under 20 based with our partner organisation, Iris, in Yei and 5 children supported to go to school in neighbouring countries. The total number of children supported is ever-changing depending on referrals, drop-ins and returnees to the centre. There are currently 4 ‘Aunties’ who provide practical support for the children and the upkeep of the centre, with a number of other staff and volunteers supporting throughout the year.</p>

			<p>The majority of children cared for at CCC are girls. Girls are disproportionately affected by poverty and are considered particularly vulnerable in the context of conflict, especially with regards to gender-based violence. This is apparent through the number of girls CCC accommodates. Due to the size and layout of the CCC centre, it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide care for the boys alongside the girls. In future, we will provide separate accommodation for vulnerable boys. We will continue to communicate with other organisations that are able to support vulnerable boys in South Sudan until we are able to do soon a larger scale.</p>

			<p>Starting out, CCC was an independent, organic organisation led by Cathy. Since 2007, CCC has begun to increase it’s volunteer base and programme activities through institutional donor funding, currently including UNICEF, European Union (EU), and the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) as well as Cordaid and the Canadian and Australian Embassies CCC has consistent and regular supporters in South Sudan as well as across the globe, including hundreds of public donors as well as private donations from supporter companies. Moving forwards, CCC will continue fundraising by increasing awareness internationally about the project. We intend to grow further by inviting skilled volunteers to provide support at the centre and remotely, as well as building capacity of local staff.</p>

			<p>Today, CCC has 8 dormitories, 2 classrooms-come-playrooms, a dining room, washrooms and office space, accommodating approximately 40 children at any one time. Have a look at ‘our activities’ to see what we do for the children of South Sudan.</p>
